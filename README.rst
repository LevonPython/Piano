Introduction
============

This application is a minimal functional version of syntesizer/piano. 
The application is written in python (used libraries: Tkinter, pygame).

* The  `Tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html>`_ package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 
* The `pygame <https://www.pygame.org/docs/>`_  is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language. 

============
